Buy Wild Coats back, and PsyCrystal if have none and want iris

After salt, exit/enter is faster than walking if you want Iris
Takes 55s to get Iris assuming no drain needed (sanctum warp after iris)


Magma Rock

SB all of Isaacs and Ivans djinn
Drain Isaac's pp with potent cure, defending to take dmg if needed

Def/Sleet/Def/Jupiter

Run to Main mars room, put Jenna/Felix into Ninja


-------------------------------------

Ideas: Skip Lightning Sword, Thanatos Mace to Piers
Check when to swap djinn between Piers/Sheba
Check Gel vs Balm timing (Gel takes 50s)
Skip Mold (Venus in Prox) 
Maybe look into skipping Petra instead? (S uses Ground once vs DD, maybe don't need?)
Could investigate Chill over Steam, would get both balm/gel in this case
Retreat mode on psystone in yampi to get guardian ring (maybe doesn't save time?)
Retreat warp through the yampi desert exit
Skip Iris
Actually get a proper setup for Flame Dragons and Doom Dragon (in terms of menuing)
